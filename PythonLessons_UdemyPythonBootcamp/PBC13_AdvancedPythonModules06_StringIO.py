StringIO Objects and the io Module
Back in Lecture 24 - Files we opened files that exist outside of python, 
and streamed their contents into an in-memory file object. You can also 
create in-memory file-like objects within your program that Python treats 
the same way. Text data is stored in a StringIO object, while binary data 
would be stored in a BytesIO object. This object can then be used as input 
or output to most functions that would expect a standard file object.

Let's investigate StringIO objects. The best way to show this is by example:

import io
In [2]:
# Arbitrary String
message = 'This is just a normal string.'
In [3]:
# Use StringIO method to set as file object
f = io.StringIO(message)
Now we have an object f that we will be able to treat just like a file. For example:

In [4]:
f.read()
Out[4]:
'This is just a normal string.'
We can also write to it:

In [5]:
f.write(' Second line written to file like object')
Out[5]:
40
In [6]:
# Reset cursor just like you would a file
f.seek(0)
Out[6]:
0
In [7]:
# Read again
f.read()
Out[7]:
'This is just a normal string. Second line written to file like object'
In [8]:
# Close the object when contents are no longer needed
f.close()
Great! Now you've seen how we can use StringIO to turn normal strings 
into in-memory file objects in our code. This kind of action has various 
use cases, especially in web scraping cases where you want to read some 
string you scraped as a file.
